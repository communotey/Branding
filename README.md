###Restrictions

* You are not allowed to overprint type, photos, or elements over the brandmark.
* You are not allowed to change the dimension ratio within 90% accuracy, which means you're free to try to draw out the symbol even if you're bad at drawing, have an unsteady hand, or if you make an accident.

###Freedoms

* You are free to change the size and blow up the vectors as much as you want
* You are free to copy and reuse any of the graphics (noncommercially) as long as you tell people where they're from. That is, you don't need permission to post these pictures on your website (and hotlinking with <img> is fine); just include a link back to this page.
* You are free to change the colours of the shapes as much as you want.
