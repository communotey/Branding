You are free to change the colours of the shapes as long as you do not change the dimension ratio within 90% accuracy, which means you're free to try to draw out the symbol even if you're bad at drawing, have an unsteady hand, or messed up. That also means you are allowed to alter the size and blow up the vectors as much as you want.

You are not allowed to overprint type, photos, or elements over the brandmark.
